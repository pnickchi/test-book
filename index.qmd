# Preface {.unnumbered}

> **Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the numerous fundamental hypothesis tests you need to learn in statistical inference courses?**

We have experienced this sense of overwhelm throughout our academic journeys as well. However, we also understand that statistical inference is a **powerful tool** for gaining insights into complex populations across various fields of study. Whether analyzing electoral preferences in political science or assessing the effectiveness of innovative medical treatments in randomized clinical trials, the applications are extensive. Hence, in response to these challenges, we have created this mini-book as a handy resource to help structure and simplify the learning of different fundamental hypothesis tests. Our goal is to present these concepts in a **reader-friendly manner** while clearly explaining the necessary statistical jargon, making these inferential methods accessible to a broader audience.

Note that, after conducting extensive research into the available educational literature, we discovered that there is no comprehensive and **frequentist** resource that explains various inferential methods simultaneously using **two essential programming languages** in the field of data science: `R` [@r2024] and `Python`[@python]. Furthermore, we could not find reproducible and transparent tools that would enable learners to implement and adapt these methods in their own computational environments. Based on our teaching experience, these shortcomings hinder effective learning in the practice of statistical inference, especially given the numerous tests required to achieve mastery.

To address this gap, we have developed a bilingual and frequentist resource in both `R` and `Python`, which features a **common test workflow** consisting of eight distinct stages applicable to each hypothesis test: *study design*, *data collection and wrangling*, *exploratory data analysis*, *testing settings*, *hypothesis definitions*, *test flavour and components*, *inferential conclusions*, and *storytelling*. Additionally, all the tests we discuss are organized through different mind maps to help readers visualize their learning process. Finally, by offering this mini-book as an Open Educational Resource (OER) in Quarto via a GitHub repository, we aim to inspire and empower academic communities worldwide to share and adapt this knowledge to suit their specific needs.
