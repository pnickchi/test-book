# Meet the Authors {.unnumbered}

*The Mini Test Book* is a collaborative project created by three educators and researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC). This open educational resource integrates their expertise in statistic, bioinformatics, and data science pedagogy to make concepts related to hypothesis testing and model evaluation more accessible to learners. Each author provides a unique perspective, encompassing areas such as teaching, curriculum design, applied machine learning, and bioinformatics research. They are united by a common commitment to clarity, reproducibility, and open science. The following sections will introduce the authors and outline their academic and professional backgrounds.

> I'm an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Statistics and Master of Data Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've been involved in diverse fields, such as credit risk management, statistical consulting, and data science teaching. My doctoral research in statistics is primarily focused on computer experiments that emulate scientific and engineering systems via Gaussian stochastic processes (i.e., kriging regression). I'm incredibly passionate about teaching regression topics while combining statistical and machine learning contexts.

> I’m a multidisciplinary professional with a blend of expertise in bioinformatics, computational chemistry, and business analysis. Currently, I’m pursuing a Doctoral degree in Bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia (UBC), where my research focuses on leveraging generative AI and machine learning to uncover new drug candidates for cancer and infectious diseases. I combine these technologies with biostatistical analysis to validate hypotheses and ensure meaningful insights. Alongside my research, I’ve led projects in computational chemistry, managed complex data systems, and mentored students in Python programming, machine learning, and data science. For the past few years, I’ve also been working as a Teaching Assistant in UBC’s Master of Data Science program.

> I am a Postdoctoral Research and Teaching Fellow in the Department of Statistics and the Master of Data Science (MDS) program at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I completed my PhD in Statistics at Simon Fraser University (SFU), where my research focused on biostatistics and goodness-of-fit tests using empirical distribution functions. I am currently teaching statistical courses in the MDS program at UBC. My passion for statistics, teaching, and data science led me to this role. Outside of work, I enjoy swimming and capturing the night sky through astrophotography.
