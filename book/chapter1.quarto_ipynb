Whether you're evaluating whether the average recovery time from a treatment differs from a known standard, assessing whether student test scores exceed a benchmark, or testing if the proportion of success in a group differs from an expected rate, these methods help determine whether the observed values are statistically significant or simply due to chance.\n",
