# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is a mini-book on hypothesis testing in statistics. It covers the tests taught in DSCI 552 in the MDS program at UBC.

A general hypothesis testing mind map outlining all techniques explored in this book. Depending on the overall approach to be used, these techniques are divided into two broad categories: classical and simulation-based tests.

A classical-based hypothesis testing workflow structured in four substages: *general settings*, *hypotheses definitions*, *test flavour and components*, and *inferential conclusions*.
