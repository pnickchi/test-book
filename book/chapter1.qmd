# Chapter 1: Tests for One Continuous Population Mean {.unnumbered}

This chapter introduces statistical tests designed to analyze a single sample, which is a fundamental task in data analysis across many disciplines. Whether you're evaluating whether the average recovery time from a treatment differs from a known standard, assessing whether student test scores exceed a benchmark, or testing if the proportion of success in a group differs from an expected rate, these methods help determine whether the observed values are statistically significant or simply due to chance.

A specific hypothesis testing mind map outlining the techniques explored in this chapter, which are classical tests for one continuous population mean.
:::

There are several statistical tests used to evaluate hypotheses about a single sample. The appropriate test depends on the type of variable (mean or proportion), sample size, and whether population parameters like variance are known.

We test whether a population mean equals a specific value. The right test depends on:

-   Type of response
-   Whether the population variance is known
-   Sample size

In this chapter, we focus on statistical tests used to evaluate hypotheses about a **single population mean** or **proportion**, based on sample data. These tests help determine whether a sample provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the population mean (or proportion) differs from a specified value.

We cover two cases for the mean — depending on whether the population variance is known or unknown — and one test for binary outcomes where we're testing a population proportion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key tests include:

## One-sample z-test for the mean

Use this test when: - The population variance **σ² is known**, and - The sample comes from a **normally distributed population**, or the **sample size is large** (typically ( n \geq 30 )).

The test statistic is:

$$ z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} $$

Where: - ( $\bar{x}$ ) is the sample mean\
- ( $\mu_0$ ) is the hypothesized population mean\
- ( $\sigma$ ) is the known population standard deviation\
- ( n ) is the sample size

We compare the calculated ( z )-value to a standard normal distribution to compute a p-value or make a decision based on a critical value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-sample t-test for the mean

Use this test when:
- The population variance **is unknown**, and
- The sample is either **normally distributed** or **large enough** to rely on the central limit theorem.


Imagine you want to assess whether a new method of teaching introductory physics improves student performance compared to the traditional method previously used. To explore this, you test the new method at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and compare the results to historical data from students who were taught using the traditional approach. This historical data serves as your **reference value**.

Suppose the population has an unknown average physics score, denoted as:

$$
\mu \quad \text{(mean physics score at UBC)}
$$

Since we do not have access to the grades of all students, we take a **random sample** from the population. Let this sample consist of $n$ students, with observed scores:

$$
X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n
$$

The central question becomes:

> **Is the mean physics score in our sample statistically different from a given reference value?**

If, for example, the historical average physics score is known to be **75**, then our question becomes more specific:

> **Is the mean physics score in the sample statistically different from 75?**

### Hypotheses

We can formally express this with the following hypotheses:

- **Null hypothesis** $H_0$: $\mu = 75$
- **Alternative hypothesis** $H_1$: $\mu \ne 75$

Under the null hypothesis, we assume that the average score under the new method is equal to the historical average of 75. If the null is rejected, we conclude that there is a **statistically significant difference**, suggesting that the new method may lead to either **higher or lower** average performance.

The test statistic is:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}$$

Where: - ( s ) is the sample standard deviation (used instead of ( $\sigma$ ))

This statistic follows a **t-distribution** with ( n - 1 ) degrees of freedom. 




## Study Design

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-sample z-test for proportions

Use this test when: - The variable is **binary** (success/failure, yes/no, etc.), and - You want to test a **population proportion** ( p ), using a large enough sample.

The test statistic is:

$$z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1 - p_0)/n}}$$

Where: - ( $\hat{p}$ ) is the sample proportion\
- ( $p_0$ ) is the hypothesized population proportion\
- ( $n$ ) is the sample size

This test assumes ( $np_0 \geq 5$ ) and ( $n(1 - p_0)$ $\geq$ 5 ) to justify the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.
