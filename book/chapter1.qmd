# Chapter 1: Tests for One Continuous Population Mean {.unnumbered}

This chapter introduces statistical tests designed to analyze a single sample, which is a fundamental task in data analysis across many disciplines. Whether you're evaluating whether the average recovery time from a treatment differs from a known standard, assessing whether student test scores exceed a benchmark, or testing if the proportion of success in a group differs from an expected rate, these methods help determine whether the observed values are statistically significant or simply due to chance.

A specific hypothesis testing mind map outlining the techniques explored in this chapter, which are classical tests for one continuous population mean.
:::

There are several statistical tests used to evaluate hypotheses about a single sample. The appropriate test depends on the type of variable (mean or proportion), sample size, and whether population parameters like variance are known.

We test whether a population mean equals a specific value. The right test depends on:

-   Type of response
-   Whether the population variance is known
-   Sample size

In this chapter, we focus on statistical tests used to evaluate hypotheses about a **single population mean** or **proportion**, based on sample data. These tests help determine whether a sample provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the population mean (or proportion) differs from a specified value.

We cover two cases for the mean — depending on whether the population variance is known or unknown — and one test for binary outcomes where we're testing a population proportion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key tests include:

## One-sample z-test for the mean

Use this test when: - The population variance **σ² is known**, and - The sample comes from a **normally distributed population**, or the **sample size is large** (typically ( n \geq 30 )).

The test statistic is:

$$ z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} $$

Where: - ( $\bar{x}$ ) is the sample mean\
- ( $\mu_0$ ) is the hypothesized population mean\
- ( $\sigma$ ) is the known population standard deviation\
- ( n ) is the sample size

We compare the calculated ( z )-value to a standard normal distribution to compute a p-value or make a decision based on a critical value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-sample t-test for the mean

Use this test when: - The population variance **is unknown**, and - The sample is either **normally distributed** or **large enough** to rely on the central limit theorem.

The test statistic is:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}$$

Where: - ( s ) is the sample standard deviation (used instead of ( $\sigma$ ))

This statistic follows a **t-distribution** with ( n - 1 ) degrees of freedom. It is more appropriate for real-world scenarios where we rarely know the true population variance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-sample z-test for proportions

Use this test when: - The variable is **binary** (success/failure, yes/no, etc.), and - You want to test a **population proportion** ( p ), using a large enough sample.

The test statistic is:

$$z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1 - p_0)/n}}$$

Where: - ( $\hat{p}$ ) is the sample proportion\
- ( $p_0$ ) is the hypothesized population proportion\
- ( $n$ ) is the sample size

This test assumes ( $np_0 \geq 5$ ) and ( $n(1 - p_0)$ $\geq$ 5 ) to justify the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.
