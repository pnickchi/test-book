# Chapter 1: Tests for One Sample {.unnumbered}

This chapter introduces statistical tests designed to analyze a single sample, which is a fundamental task in data analysis across many disciplines. Whether you're evaluating whether the average recovery time from a treatment differs from a known standard, assessing whether student test scores exceed a benchmark, or testing if the proportion of success in a group differs from an expected rate, these methods help determine whether the observed values are statistically significant or simply due to chance.

There are several statistical tests used to evaluate hypotheses about a single sample. The appropriate test depends on the type of variable (mean or proportion), sample size, and whether population parameters like variance are known. Key tests include:

## One-sample z-test for the mean

Used when the population variance is known. This test compares the sample mean to a hypothesized population mean.

## One-sample t-test for the mean

Used when the population variance is unknown and the sample is either normally distributed or sufficiently large. It compares the sample mean to a hypothesized value under these more realistic conditions.

## One-sample z-test for proportions

Used to test whether the observed proportion in a sample differs significantly from a hypothesized population proportion.
