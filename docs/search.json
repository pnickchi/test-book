    "section": "Independent Samples",
    "text": "Independent Samples\nIndependent samples arise when the observations in one group do not influence or relate to the observations in the other. A classic example comes from educational research:\nSuppose you’re interested in whether a new method of teaching introductory physics improves student performance. To investigate this, you decide to test the method at two universities: the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Simon Fraser University (SFU). You apply the new teaching method at SFU and compare the results to students taught with the traditional method at UBC.\nIn this scenario, students at UBC and SFU form two distinct, unrelated groups. Since the students are not paired or matched across schools, and each individual belongs to only one group, the samples are independent.\nLet us assume that each population has an unknown average physics score—denoted by:\n\\[\n    \\mu_1 \\quad \\text{(mean for UBC)}, \\quad \\mu_2 \\quad \\text{(mean for SFU)}.\n\\]\nSince we don’t have access to all students’ grades, we take a random sample from each school. Suppose:\n\nFrom UBC (Population 1), we obtain a sample of size \\(n\\), denoted as: \\[X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\]\nFrom SFU (Population 2), we obtain a sample of size \\(m\\), denoted as: \\[Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_m\\]\n\nNote that the sample sizes \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) do not need to be equal. Now, the central question becomes:\nIs there a statistically significant difference between the mean physics scores of the two groups?\nIn formal terms, we test the hypotheses:\n\\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_A: \\mu_1 \\ne \\mu_2\\]\nTo test this, we use the two-sample t-test, which compares the sample means and incorporates variability within and between the samples. If we assume equal population variances, the test statistic is:\n\\[t = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\bar{Y}}{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}}}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\n\\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\) are the sample means for UBC and SFU, respectively,\n\n\\(s_p\\) is the , computed as:\n\\(s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n - 1)s_X^2 + (m - 1)s_Y^2}{n + m - 2}}\\)\n\n\\(s_X^2\\) and \\(s_Y^2\\) are the sample variances of the two groups.\n\nIf the assumption of equal variances is questionable, we instead use Welch’s t-test, which adjusts the standard error and degrees of freedom accordingly.\nIf the normality assumption is also not satisfied (e.g., due to skewed distributions or outliers), we may turn to a non-parametric alternative, such as the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test, which compares the ranks of the observations across groups rather than the raw values but this book will not cover it.\nNow let us see how we can run the test on some example datasets in R!\nExample dataset in R\n\nTBD\nHow to code in R?\n\n# This is example for now. I will replace it later with a real dataset\nx &lt;- rnorm(100)\ny &lt;- rnorm(200, mean = 10)\nt.test(x, y)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  x and y\nt = -80.798, df = 214.02, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -10.133415  -9.650772\nsample estimates:\n  mean of x   mean of y \n-0.03084369  9.86124949",
